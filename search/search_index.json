We ask that chapters and communities within our network explain this to donors appropriately.\n\n\nTypes of Donors\n\n\nMost Chapters and Communities raise funds for their activities primarily via corporate sponsorships. Once your group has a Volunteer Fundraiser signed up, they can reach out to companies in your area who might be interested in supporting your activities.\n\n\nVolunteer Fundraisers can also raise money from individual donors if desired. \n\n\nMethods of Payment\n\n\nRegardless of whether you are receiving donations from a company or an individual, our options for accepting payments are the same. Most of the time the Volunteer Fundraiser will submit an invoice request and we will send the donor an invoice that can include payment options of check, ACH bank transfer, and credit card. Learn more about how to do this on the \ninvoice request page\n. We also offer \nPayPal buttons\n for Chapters. We can't accept cash donations.\n\n\nCrowdfunding & Other Methods\n\n\nIf you want to raise or process donations in any method different from those explicitly outlined in this operations guide, including crowdfunding, please contact us at finance@bridgefoundry.org and we will explore options with you. We need to make sure that any new approach fits in with our policies and procedures before moving forward, and our goal is to support you however we can.

Students become TAs become Teachers. The best teachers are those who have learned most recently, and have a passion for giving back to a community that fostered their own development. Companies benefit when we expand the talent pool, and their staff who volunteer at workshops become more expert through teaching and improving their leadership and communication skills.  Bridge leaders are encouraged to innovate with new techniques for creating diverse and inclusive communities, for example, the GoBridge podcast and Slack community.\n\n\nWhen curricula are developed for a programming language or subject matter area or volunteers start to engage in this work, we traditionally choose a name that includes the word \u201cBridge.\u201d For example, our curriculum for Ruby on Rails is referred to as \u201cRailsBridge.\u201d  \n\n\nNaming note: so we can explore IP protections and in the future accept checks for any Bridge, the current thinking is that all the Bridge names are technically synonymous with Bridge Foundry.\n\n\nRoles\n\n\nVolunteer Bridge Leader\n\n\nSeparate from the creation and availability of curricula for a particular technology, volunteers may opt to create a Bridge leadership board, so they may promote use of a particular curriculum and provide deeper guidance and support for curriculum users. Bridge Leaders complete our \nVolunteer Agreement\n, which references specific \nBridge Leader Policies\n.\n\n\nIndependent Community\n\n\nMost of the groups we work with are Independent Communities (usually referred to as \u201cCommunities\u201d for short). Communities use a Bridge curriculum, agree to our Workshop Guidelines, and align themselves publicly with Bridge Foundry by using one of our official names (like RailsBridge, ClojureBridge, etc).  They are not legally part of Bridge Foundry, Inc. but we support them in a variety of ways, as requested, including our Bridge Troll registration system, guidance and grants.\n\n\nChapter\n\n\nChapters have a lot in common with Communities. They agree to our Workshop Guidelines and use a version of one of our official names. They can access the same resources like fundraising advice and use of Bridge Troll. They also have some additional benefits:\n\n Access to finance infrastructure, such as Pex cards and online donation processing through their website\n\n Access to the benefits of being part of a nonprofit organization, which can include things like discounts and access to some in-kind gifts\n* In the future, active Bridge Foundry Chapters will also be covered by our liability insurance, in the unlikely event that there\u2019s some kind of legal action.\n\n\nIn order to become a Chapter, groups will:\n\n Have one or more leaders who make a commitment to lead the chapter (for at least one year)\n\n Have some track record with the organization and plan to hold at least 2 events in the upcoming year\n\n Complete our Volunteer Agreement\n\n Meet with their Bridge leader and/or a volunteer mentor once a year to share knowledge about successes and challenges\n\n\nChapters typically have one or more volunteer fundraisers (see below). Chapter Leaders complete our \nVolunteer Agreement\n, which references specific \nChapter Leader Policies\n.\n\n\nProgram\n\n\nSometimes we support groups that don\u2019t follow the Bridge model for engaging underrepresented communities, but are clearly mission aligned. Women Who Go is an example of this type of program currently; Test First Teaching and the Teaching Kids initiative are past programs that are not currently active.  \n\n\nWhile their needs are slightly different, programs like these generally follow our operational guidelines for fundraising and expenses, as well as following our Code of Conduct or approved equivalent. They may also have an opportunity to access the additional resources available for Chapters (as a \u201cProgram\u201d) provided that they have active leadership in place and we have capacity to support them. Leaders of Programs that operate as a legal part of Bridge Foundry, Inc. (similar to Chapters) complete our \nVolunteer Agreement\n, which references specific \nProgram Leader Policies\n.\n\n\nVolunteer Fundraiser\n\n\nVolunteer fundraisers are just what they sound like: individuals can help raise money generally for Bridge Foundry, or specifically for a Community, Chapter, Program, or Bridge. The main caveat is that all funds raised technically need to be unrestricted funds to allow the organization to act when volunteers become inactive. (\u201cUnrestricted\u201d is a technical term in the fundraising world that indicates the money can be used generally to support our mission, rather than needing to track and report on funds allocated and spent for very specific purposes.) Volunteer Fundraisers complete our \nVolunteer Agreement\n, which references specific \nfundraising policies\n.\n\n\nCommon Questions\n\n\nInternational groups\n\n\nWe have inspired a global movement, with workshops using Bridge curriculum offered around the world. Yet there are logistical limits to the activities our formal US corporation can directly pursue in other countries. At this time, we are not able to legally operate in other countries, so international groups cannot become Chapters. We also cannot provide grants to individuals in other countries, so international Communities aren\u2019t currently eligible for financial grants. We do have communities with relationships with nonprofits in other countries, and we\u2019re learning about whether we could extend those relationships to help more Communities internationally. \n\n\nWhat international groups CAN do is:\n\n Operate as an Independent Community and make use of the non-financial resources we provide\n\n Partner with a local nonprofit entity in your country to raise and receive money for workshops \u2014 please talk to us, if you are exploring this, so we can help share knowledge with other people in your country\n* Let us know if you are outside of the US and want financial support, as that helps us understand the need\n\n\nHow funding works for these roles\n\n\nChapters that have a Volunteer Fundraiser are able to raise funds directly for their activities and spend those funds using a few different methods. See more detail in the Chapter Leader Policies.\n\n\nCommunities may also raise funds for their activities via a Volunteer Fundraiser, and they need to apply for a grant to receive those funds. We will approve the grant as long as those raised funds are available and both the application and the Community follow our policies. Communities may apply for a grant for multiple workshops to reduce the administrative work of multiple applications. Grants are usually paid out as reimbursements for expenses, but cash advances are also an option.\n\n\nWe also provide grants to both Chapters and Communities that are having trouble locating a sponsor. These grants are approved on a first-come basis. They are always approved as long as we have funds available and the application meets well-documented guidelines, where innovation is allowed and encouraged with a review process. To really scale, we rely on local fundraising, so we\u2019re also looking at creating a local fundraising kit so we can encourage volunteers in each region to develop these skills and relationships.",

Bridge board members recruit new leaders regularly to create a sustainable leadership team, with mentorship from Bridge Foundry staff and volunteers as needed.. Serving multiple terms is an option for Bridge leaders, though Bridge Foundry encourages turnover in this role to cultivate new leaders in your community.

This is for multiple reasons: so that we have an accurate record of the current number of Volunteer Fundraisers with up-to-date contact information and to ensure that everyone remembers what they have agreed.\n\n\nBridge Foundry's Responsibilities\n\n\nDuring your term as Volunteer Fundraiser (as long as you follow policies), Bridge Foundry will:\n\n Provide materials about Bridge Foundry that you can use in conversations with donors\n\n Answer your questions about processing donations\n* Allocate funds you raise to the chapter, program, or purpose indicated on the volunteer agreement as long as there are active volunteers who need funding for mission-aligned activities, consistent with our operational policies.\n\n\nVolunteer Fundraiser's Responsibilities:\n\n\nBy signing the Volunteer Agreement, Volunteer Fundraisers agree to:\n\n Explain to donors that donations are technically raised as \u201cunrestricted funds,\u201d which Bridge Foundry will apply for the specific purpose you\u2019re raising them for to the extent practical and that they may also be applied to other activities in support of Bridge Foundry\u2019s mission if there are leftover funds or a group of volunteers becomes inactive. (See \u201cunrestricted funds\u201d note below.)\n  * If any online fundraising component is approved for my fundraising campaign, include specific language provided by Bridge Foundry on the campaign page about the funds being unrestricted \n\n Refrain from soliciting particular donors if requested by Bridge Foundry (See \"solicitation limitations\" note below.)\n\n Gather the donor\u2019s legal name, address, and email (for companies, gather a legal company name and a contact person name)\n\n Direct donors to one of Bridge Foundry\u2019s approved online giving portals or submit an invoice request so they can pay Bridge Foundry directly. Volunteer Fundraisers may not accept cash, checks or other forms of payment directly from the donor. (See \"payment methods\" note below.)\n\n Coordinate with Bridge Foundry staff for any solicitations for Bridge Foundry general funds (vs. for a specific purpose, chapter or community)\n\n Let Bridge Foundry know if they want to raise funds using a platform, payment method or approach that is different from the primary methods the organization explicitly supports (as described in this Operations Guide).\n  * If Bridge Foundry indicates that we aren\u2019t able to support that method currently, agree not to raise funds that way.\n  * If Bridge Foundry does approve the method, communicate with Bridge Foundry staff, who will set up any required accounts. Volunteer Fundraisers do not have authority to bind the organization into agreements or open accounts in its name.\n  * Example: If I wanted to do a Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign, Bridge Foundry would need to discuss and determine whether they could support that well in advance of launching the campaign.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nUnrestricted Funds:\n While most Volunteer Fundraisers step into this role to help raise money for a specific activity, chapter, community, or program, it\u2019s important for us to explain to donors that these funds are unrestricted. That\u2019s because it gives Bridge Foundry freedom to use the money as makes sense without checking back in with the donor. For example, if you have leftover money from one workshop, we can apply it to the next one. If your chapter or community becomes inactive and it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to start back up but it still has some money leftover, we have the ability to use that money to support a new group somewhere else. And, if we don\u2019t have a good reason like this to move the money around, we aren\u2019t going to. We appreciate your efforts in helping communicate this balanced view: that on the whole the money will be used for the purpose you are describing to the donor, and we may reallocate it to other mission-aligned activities under certain circumstances.\n\n\nSolicitation limitations:\n We plan in the near future to define some sponsorship guidelines, including some indicators of how to avoid partnering with companies or individuals who are not aligned with our mission. We may also coordinate centralized giving from major donors, and we may ask you to coordinate with us if you have an idea for how to engage with specific companies. These are both examples of cases in which we may, in the future, ask Volunteer Fundraisers not to solicit some donors.\n\n\nPayment methods:\n Volunteer fundraisers primarily solicit donations from corporate donors and then request that Bridge Foundry send them an invoice, which they can then pay via check, credit card, or ACH payment. If other methods of accepting funds are desired, we can discuss options, but Bridge Foundry needs to accept the donations directly. We expect acceptance of ongoing donations through a donation portal on websites to be available to Chapters soon.",

The Foundry is led by a Program Director and representative board.\n\n\nBridge, in this document refers to a self-governing Bridge with its own board.  Each bridge focuses on a specific technology, or set of technologies, and shares open source curriculum and program materials across geographies. Bridge leaders may add new Chapters and Chapter leaders. Sometimes people organize a single event or initiative for a new technology, independent of a Bridge and that is fine.\n\n\nChapter: a regional, technology-specific group which has held at least one event.  Each Chapter belongs to a Bridge.  An active Chapter has one or more leaders, who might do fundraising and can approve expenses if the Chapter has a budget. Chapter leaders can also have the ability to approve or edit events for their chapter and add/remove leaders for their chapter.\n\n\n\n\nOperations\n\n\nBridge Foundry is run by a small operations team, including a part time Operations Manager (operations@bridgefoundry.org) with accounting, legal, and advisory support from School Factory.\n\n\nNew Bridges can be created by anyone who wants to offer programs that are aligned with our mission.  For more detail see \nhow to make a bridge\n.\n\n\nEvent Organizing\n\n\nWe have an open source event registration system, \nBridge Troll\n, which has been developed by RailsBridge volunteers. While many leaders use Meetup or EventBrite to organize events, we developed Bridge Troll as a way to effectively manage separate lists of volunteers and students, allowing for ongoing profiles and tracking of history, which is not well-supported by other online tools.  We strongly encourage all volunteers who are organizing events to use Bridge Troll.  Please file an \nissue\n or join the \nmailing list\n if you have feedback.  To learn more about it, please check out the \nwiki\n.\n\n\nFinance\n\n\nDirecting Funds\n\n\nIt is our policy that the group (Foundry, Bridge or Chapter) that raises funds, gets to direct how the funds are spent; however, donations must be provided without restriction to Bridge Foundry, so as to streamline our internal processes (more on that below). We often communicate our intentions to sponsors and report on our progress, but it is important that those reports are not a formal commitment to allocate an exact amount of money to a specific program.  This allows the leadership of the Foundry, Bridge or Chapter the flexibility to reallocate funds as needed.\n\n\nWhen volunteers or staff raise funds via Bridge Foundry, they will associate the donation(s) with a specific Workshop, Chapter, Bridge, or Bridge Foundry.  All funds must be spent only on educational and charitable activities that are aligned with our mission. All expenses must be approved by a Workshop or Chapter leader, a Bridge board member, or a designated volunteer or staff person.  \n\n\nAllowed Expenses\n\n\nAny Bridge or Chapter will utilize funds only for charitable and educational activities consistent with our tax-exempt status described above. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Bridge will not intervene in any election or support or oppose any political party or candidate for public office, or engage in any lobbying not permitted by section 501(c)(3) of the IRC, or, if applicable, IRC 501\u00a7\u00a7(h) and 4911. Bridges or Chapters will not endorse political candidates or parties.\n\n\nFinancial Guidance\n\n\nThe Finance Committee is composed of staff and volunteers.

Everyone in [*Bridge] is a volunteer, and our funding comes mostly from technology companies working with us to improve diversity in the tech community.\n\n\nWhat is a Preferred Vendor?\n\n\nIn locations where we hold workshops repeatedly, we're developing relationships with companies that provide meals and childcare for the workshops. This established relationship makes it easier for volunteer workshop organizers and for vendors who do business with us. We'll try to set a standard order for Preferred Vendors that can be scaled up or down for the headcount of a given workshop. After that, for each workshop, a workshop organizer will provide the headcount and workshop location.\n\n\nWe would like to make the experience for [*Bridge] Preferred Vendors as seamless as possible. Please give us feedback if something is difficult or inconvenient from your side; the best email for that feedback is [your email here].\n\n\nHow do vendors get paid?\n\n\nWe are part of Bridge Foundry, a 501c3 nonprofit organization.

The bank account information should belong to the individual who is requesting reimbursement.

You will need your routing and account numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the account is added, Expensify will make three deposits into your account that you will need to verify in order to receive reimbursement via the account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitting Reports\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new report and add your expenses: \n\n\nFor workshop expenses, include the date(s) of the workshop in the report name.\n\n\nCheck the \"reimburseable\" box on each expense that you paid out of pocket and uncheck the box for Pex card expenses.\n\n\n\n\nSelect an expense category and a tag (your chapter/community name or general fund) for each individual expense. List specifics in the Comment field for expenses in the Other category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble check that your report meets the following criteria - these are required for reimbursement!\n\n\n\n\nAll expenses must have itemized receipts attached. (Include both itemized receipt and payment receipt if tips included in final total. Invoices that don't list an amount paid do not count as receipts. We need to see that you paid the invoice. Use our \ntemplate\n for on-site service providers if they don't provide receipts.) See note at the bottom of this page about how to submit multiple receipts!\n\n\nExpenses must be for a chapter or fund for which you are approved to submit expenses, and must follow our \nallowed expense policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the report using the button near the top left of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, add a bank account so you can receive payment.

Combine all receipts for that expense into a single document and then upload that for the receipt. We will scroll through when reviewing the receipts.\n2. Or, include additional receipts/documents at the bottom of the report as \"attachments.\" If it looks like something is missing, we will check the attachments before asking you about it.\n\n\nSubmitting a Report for Someone Else\n\n\nIf you need to submit a report on someone else's behalf, take the following additional steps:\n- Include the name of the volunteer to be reimbursed in the report name\n- Add a comment at the bottom of the report with the name and postal address of the volunteer who should be sent a check.",

If you are getting reimbursed, add your bank account (do this before submitting your report to get paid faster!) The bank account information should belong to the individual who is requesting reimbursement. Each individual that needs reimbursement generally signs up for their own account and enters their own bank information.

On the right side of the screen, select \"Reimbursement\", then add a deposit account. You will need your routing and account numbers.

Note: receipts need not be submitted if a sponsor pays for something directly.  We track receipts for all money that is donated to Bridge Foundry and then spent for our programs.  There are two ways to submit receipts:\n- submit an  expense report \n- send receipts via email to finance@bridgefoundry.org. Include the date of the workshop in your email.  The receipts and the above requirements are not only for our collective records, but are required for tax purposes, ensuring that we can maintain our 501(c)(3) status. If you have questions or run into challenges, just let us know by contacting finance@bridgefoundry.org.",
