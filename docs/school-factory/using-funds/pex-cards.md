# PEX Card
A Pex Card works as a debit card and it is designed to add greater flexibility and accessibility to funds for our most active organizers. Each card costs $7.50/month, so we need to reserve these cards for active chapters and organizers.

## Who may request a card
- Must have organized at least 3 workshops.
- Plans to have workshops at least once per quarter.
- Is either a chapter leader OR have approval from a Bridge or chapter leader.

## Application Process
Complete the [PEX Card Application & Agreement](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wS0NUdB2_rAVF-xAi808pll8MyHVfxB8oOpFeYb6qcg/viewform) form. Be prepared to provide the following information:

- Your First and Last Name
- Address
- Date of Birth
- Phone number
- Who your chapter leader is
- How soon you will need the card
- The amount you will need on the card for your next event

Upon approval, the card will be sent to you in as little as 2 days, with an express shipping fee, or within 14 days via regular mail.

## Use Guidelines
Once you receive your card:

- Contact finance@bridgefoundry.org to activate the card
- You will be sent a pin and asked to do a small test transaction
- We will transfer funds to your card upon request to finance@bridgefoundry.org, as long as you have enough funds for your chapter. Transfers are subject to a one week bank transfer delay, so please plan ahead!
- You can check your account balance by logging in here: https://ch.pexcard.com/  (The balance on the spreadsheet reflects total available funds, not what is on your pex card. You must make a request for us to transfer funds to pex.)

## Please note

If your chapter has received any donations into Bridge Foundry, those funds are YOURS and available to you. However, this card is a debit card, and we want to protect you from loss or theft. Regardless of your balance, it is advised that you only request what you need. 

Failure to submit an expense report within 7 days of a workshop or any misuse of funds may result in the revocation of PEX Card privileges.
