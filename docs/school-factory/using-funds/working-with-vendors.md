## Preferred vendors

We prefer to support local, independent businesses and many companies will also extend discounts to non-profit organizations.  Additionally, we can reduce the burden on future volunteers by establishing relationships, standard pricing and common menu choices.

Use the FAQ below to kick off a relationship with a Preferred Vendor. Make sure to fill in the "Local Bridge Contact" with your info before you send it to someone!

### [*Bridge] Preferred Vendor FAQs

_What is [\*Bridge]?_

[\*Bridge] is an organization that hosts free workshops each year to help people level up with programming technologies. Our focus is on increasing diversity in tech, and making the tech community a welcoming place for everyone. Everyone in [*Bridge] is a volunteer, and our funding comes mostly from technology companies working with us to improve diversity in the tech community.

_What is a Preferred Vendor?_

In locations where we hold workshops repeatedly, we're developing relationships with companies that provide meals and childcare for the workshops. This established relationship makes it easier for volunteers workshop organizers and for vendors who do business with [*Bridge]. We'll try to set a standard order for Preferred Vendors that can be scaled up or down for the headcount of a given workshop. After that, for each workshop, a workshop organizer will provide the headcount and workshop location.

We would like to make the experience for [*Bridge] Preferred Vendors as seamless as possible. Please give us feedback if something is difficult or inconvenient from your side; the best email for that feedback is [your email here].
