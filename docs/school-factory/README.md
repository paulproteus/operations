# Bridge Foundry 

Bridge Foundry and all of the Bridges is one whole organization dedicated to doing whatever it takes so that the makers of technology are reflective of our society, because diversity fosters innovation.  To learn more about who we are and what we do, see our [website](http://bridgefoundry.org/). This guide documents how we operate, providing a resource for how we work together. 

## Mission

We empower people with technology through teaching and facilitating access,
enlarging the community of people who give back and teach others.


## Operations

Bridge Foundry operates as a program of the [School Factory](http://schoolfactory.org), which is a 501c3 organization (giving us non-profit status in the USA).

The Bridge Foundry work of collecting, tracking, distributing and reporting funds for all Bridges in a tax responsible way is made possible thanks to a paid part-time Bridge Foundry employee. School Factory manages our federal reporting and other administrative overhead such as reimbursements and expense tracking.

Bridge Foundry volunteers and staff do work to support all of the Bridges and other programs.  When we were still RailsBridge, Sarah Mei and Sarah Allen had a guiding principle for structuring the organization: “let nothing stand in the way of making a workshop happen”  (if there is someone willing to lead it).  With a much larger number of programs with a diverse and distributed community of volunteers, we've elaborated on the operational goals of the organization:

* **Empower Individual Leaders**
  * Provide reliable, streamlined financial processing
* **Connect people in the community** who want to help
  * Businesses that want to fund a workshop
  * Volunteers who want to teach or start new initiatives in support of our mission
* **Provide resources that facilitate workshops**
  * Curriculum, cookbook, code-of-conduct
* **Support the growth of member organizations**
  * Example processes, centralized resources where helpful

Bridge Foundry and all of the Bridges and their Chapters manage their funds with processes that are 100% transparent.  Here is where you will find information about all of our financials and money management processes, along with operational policies.

## Bridge and Chapter Policies
Each Bridge and each Bridge Chapter maintains full autonomy over the funds they raise (more detail on [Bridge & Chapter Policies](bridge-chapter-policies.md).)

It is important to note that if you're just starting out a new workshop, do NOT
contact Bridge Foundry. Your first point of contact should be the Bridge
leader(s). If you have questions about fundraising or budgeting for your
workshop, your Bridge leader(s) will point you in the right direction to get
them answered.

## How To

Bridge Foundry provides [financial support](financial-support) in several ways. Individual volunteers or teams typically do their own fundraising for local initiatives and take advantage of Bridge Foundry 501c3 status and support systems. We do central fundraising, but often have those funds earmarked for specific purposes, so please let us know if you need funding _in advance_.

This section contains links to information about establishing, tracking, and using funds that you raise or are raised by Bridge Foundry, which you can access by applying for a grant.  Learn how to:

- [apply for a grant](financial-support/workshop-grant-applications.md) for a Bridge Foundry related event, whether or not you have an established local chapter
- [establish a fund](sponsorship) as a new Bridge or as a new Chapter of a Bridge
- [withdraw money](using-funds) for Bridge related expenses
- [monitor your funds](monitoring-your-funds.md): the up-to-date financial information for Bridge Foundry and each Bridge entity that raises money.

### Sponsorship
None of our organizations and initiatives could exist without the help of companies that sponsor our efforts and support us in our mission. In this section we provide links to information about:

- How a volunteer can [request an invoice](/sponsorship/request-invoice.md) for a sponsor
- Different ways in which companies can [send us tax-deductible donations](/sponsorship/submit-payment.md)
- Where anyone can [verify our 501c3 status](/sponsorship/verify-501c3-status.md)
