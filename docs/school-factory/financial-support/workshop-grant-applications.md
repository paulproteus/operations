# Workshop Grant Applications

If you are not an established chapter with [funds at hand](../monitoring-your-funds.md) or else have not found a sponsor to cover your workshop expenses, Bridge Foundry is committed to supporting you in putting on your workshop, so you may [apply for a grant](https://docs.google.com/a/ultrasaurus.com/forms/d/1npx6D7iFl6yx6kBVlYTOG1-PiWMsDiTx_TQWNri1WIk/viewform). **As soon as you THINK you MAY need funds, please apply!** Since some parts of the funding process can take at least a week, it's better to start working on funding earlier in your event planning than in the last few weeks.

**Important: Please follow instructions on how to [use funds](../using-funds) for information about how to submit receipts.**

## Who may request a grant
* Any organizer who wants to hold a Bridge workshop that supports the Bridge Foundry mission.
* The organizer must be either a known and experienced organizer, or must be approved by a known chapter leader or experienced volunteer organizer.

## Standard criteria
* budget is within normal parameters for the region
* expenses are for normal recommended workshop things; see list of [typical expenses](../using-funds/workshop-expenses.md)

We welcome innovative ideas. Don't be deterred if your plan is not typical -- all of our work started with a-typical ideas.

## Approval process
Grant applications are evaluated within a calendar week of submission. If funds are available, first-time grant applications for Bridge workshops that meet standard criteria by an approved organizer are dispensed without further evaluation.

If grant applications exceed current funding, the Bridge Foundry program director will assess impact and make a decision or raise additional funds to cover all applications.

## Post-Event

When you do receive funding from Bridge Foundry, we ask that you simply write a short blog post after your event on the [Bridge Foundry blog](http://bridgefoundry.org/blog.html) about how the grant helped you and your community hold the workshop and the difference it has made.

Sharing your experience inspires and helps other organizers understand what it takes to hold a workshop. You can submit a blog post as a [pull request](https://github.com/bridgefoundry/bridgefoundry.github.io/tree/master/_posts) or email to the [Bridge Foundry group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bridgefoundry).
