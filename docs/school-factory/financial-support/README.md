# Financial support

## Workshop grants
Bridge Foundry is committed to providing financial support to anyone who wants to organize a workshop but hasn't been able to raise funds for workshop expenses, whether it is a newcomer or a established chapter. Please read the [guidelines and instructions](workshop-grant-applications.md) for grant applications.

## Bookkeeping
Bridge Foundry provides all of the bookkeeping necessary, allowing everyone to have visibility and [monitor funds](../monitoring-your-funds.md).

It is important to note that whether you paid out of pocket and would like to request reimbursement, or someone paid for your expenses directly, you MUST submit receipts to Bridge Foundry (see [using-funds](../using-funds). It is important for us to have these not only for our records, but to maintain our status as a 501(c)(3). Failure to do so may result in the denial of future grant requests.

## Operational cost coverage
Bridge Foundry is committed to ensuring that 100% of funds received from a sponsor will be available to the Bridge or chapter that raised it. We use funds received from our general sponsorship to cover the 12.5% overhead charged for us to operate as a program of the School Factory, as well as to cover fees for some shared services.

## Sponsorship
Bridge Foundry is primarily funded by the generous support of corporate sponsors.  If you would like to financially contribute to help make this work happen, please email finance@bridgefoundry.org.  If you are a volunteer who has an interested sponsor, see the [sponsorship](../sponsorship) guide.
