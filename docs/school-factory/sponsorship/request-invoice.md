# Request an invoice
To request an invoice for a sponsor, please complete the [Bridge Foundry Invoice Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gu6WG2Nifj_579VhML_KZWpvi0bM0YpqsgZptSmU6Lw/viewform). Your donor may pay the invoice by ACH, check or credit card. We’re charged a 3.40% + 25¢ fee for credit card transactions, which are deducted from the total donation you receive. In order to maximize your donation, we recommend either encouraging your donor to use the ACH option, or asking them if they will consider covering the fees. Please complete one form for each sponsor.

## Upon Submission
You will generally receive an email confirmation of receipt from the Bridge Foundry operations manager, within 1 business day. An electronic invoice will be sent to the recipient's email address you specified in the request form within a week, generally on the Monday following the date of your request. We do not currently offer hard copy invoices.

If you do not receive an acknowledgement email confirmation within 24 hours, please contact operations@bridgefoundry.org for assistance in following up.
