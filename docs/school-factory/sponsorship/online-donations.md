# Online Donations

If you want to accept electronic donations online, we provide a number of options for that through Flipcause. You can:
- Embed a form directly on your website, like [this](https://bridgefoundry.org/donate)
- Embed a button on your website that pops open the form
- Request a hosted donations page if you don’t have your own website

For any of these options, complete the [Flipcause Integration Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgvgqrVn1WjquS1XDYGRWdVA2yVXCkbr7O8zOFczYhA1rUSw/viewform) and we will send you the code to embed in your own https-enabled website (not available for custom domains via github pages, but free on Firebase hosting) and/or the link for the hosted page.

Flipcause charges a fee of 4.9% + 30 cents per transaction, which they allow the donor to pay. Most donors choose to pay the fee, but if they decline to do so the amount of money you receive will be lessened by that amount. For this reason, we still recommend larger donors [mail a check](submit-payment.md) or you [request an invoice](request-invoice.md) as explained on the [sponsorship](../sponsorship/) page, and ask them to pay via check or ACH. 

Online payments using Flipcause integration are great for smaller individual donations, especially if a donor is interested in setting up a recurring payment.

We will follow up with you within a week of receiving the integration request. Feel free to email [finance@bridgefoundry.org](mailto:finance@bridgefoundry.org) if you don’t hear back or have questions.


## Crowdfunding Campaigns

We use Flipcause for crowdfunding campaigns. If you are interested in running a crowdfunding campaign, please fill out the [Flipcause Integration Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgvgqrVn1WjquS1XDYGRWdVA2yVXCkbr7O8zOFczYhA1rUSw/viewform) and select the crowdfunding campaign type. We will also need the following additional information before we can launch the campaign:
- A list of all the giving levels you want to use and any rewards for each one
- The fair market value of each reward
- All the text you want to use for the campaign description

Once we receive the completed [Flipcause Integration Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgvgqrVn1WjquS1XDYGRWdVA2yVXCkbr7O8zOFczYhA1rUSw/viewform), we will follow up with you to get this additional information. 

Since crowdfunding campaigns have the most moving parts to setup and test, please allow at least 2 weeks to get the campaign ready for launch after you have submitted the request form. We may also need to email back and forth a few times to clarify some of the reward value details, so your responsiveness will make a difference in how quickly the campaign can launch.

Before you publicize your page, please reach out to us to test it. There are a lot of small pieces of text that are in the email response and social sharing, that are hard to review until it is live. Just send a note to [finance@bridgefoundry.org](mailto:finance@bridgefoundry.org) and we can schedule time to work together on it. We want it to work optimally for you! 

We will follow up with you within a week of receiving the integration request. Feel free to email [finance@bridgefoundry.org](mailto:finance@bridgefoundry.org) if you don’t receive a response within a couple of days or have questions.

## Paypal Donations 

As we transition to using Flipcause exclusively, we are continuing our support of exsiting Paypal buttons, we are not creating any new ones. Please email us at [finance@bridgefoundry.org](mailto:finance@bridgefoundry.org) if you have questions or issues with the Paypal button on your site. 

### Important Details About Paypal
The donor can be directed to a page back on your site and that can be the home page or a thank you page. We're recommending the latter.
This does not replace the Invoice request process for larger corporate sponsors who would like a tax-deductible receipt.
Paypal takes 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction, so we still recommend larger donors [mail a check](submit-payment.md) or you [request an invoice](request-invoice.md) as explained on the [sponsorship](../sponsorship/) page, and ask them to pay via check or ACH.
