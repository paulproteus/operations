# Fund Raising
Bridge Foundry is able to accept **tax-deductible donations** on behalf of Bridges, workshops, and event organizers, and make those funds available for use by the Bridge members and organizers. 

If what you are doing to raise funds is not listed here, please let us know -- we work with lawyers and accountants to make sure everything is a-ok. We want to support you!

We raise funds in a few different ways:
* Sponsorship 
* Individual Donations
* Employer Match
* Crowdfunding Campaigns
* Revenue sharing

## Sponsorship
- Typically, a sponsor asks for an invoice OR says that they will send a check (we'll invoice them just to streamline our process and be able to track who is actually doing what.)
- A Bridge member or workshop organizer [submits an invoice request](request-invoice.md) on behalf of the sponsor.
- Upon receiving the Bridge Foundry invoice, the sponsor [submits the payment](submit-payment.md) to Bridge Foundry.
- Bridge Foundry's bookkeeper adds the amount to the [Bridge or chapter fund](../monitoring-your-funds.md).
- For information about how a Bridge member or organizer can withdraw funds, please see our instructions for [using funds](../using-funds).
- School Factory will send a thank you letter with tax deduction info to sponsor when payment is received.

## Electronic Donations
As of March 2017, we are shifting to using Flipcause.  We will write up some process around that -- for now, if you want to accept donations via website or crowdfunding campaign, please contact finance@bridgefoundry.org.

For large recurring donations, such as a revenue share, we can accept bank transfers. These are arranged on a case-by-case basis.  Contact finance@bridgefoundry.org if this applies to you).

We still support paypal for the sites that already have a button.  At some point, we will likely ask you to change; however, we don't have any timeline yet for this and will work with individual volunteers to make the process smooth. (For historical reference, here are the instructions on how we used to [request a paypal button](paypal-donations.md) for your website to collect small donations earmarked for your Chapter.


## Cash Donations
Unfortunately, we cannot provide tax documentation for cash donations (including checks or gift cards) given directly to an individual or Chapter. Funds need to be donated using one of the methods described on this page, so that everything is tracked through our accounting system to keep our 501(c)(3) records in order.  

## In-Kind Donations
In-kind donations of actual items can be logged in a form at [http://schoolfactory.org/donate](http://schoolfactory.org/donate). Submitting that form will trigger our finance person to send the sponsor an acknowledgement letter usable for tax purposes.
