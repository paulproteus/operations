# Submit payment
There are three methods by which an individual donor or sponsor may send money to a Bridge or chapter. Note that an [invoice](request-invoice.md) should also be sent to the sponsor prior to receiving payment.

## Direct ACH Payment
There will be a "Pay Now" button on invoices sent to sponsors. If they would like to pay via ACH, let your sponsor know they can select the "bank" payment option on the invoice when they receive it. They will need to have their bank routing and account information available. We are charged a small 50 cent fee for this option.

## Check
Make checks out to **Bridge Foundry** and mail to the address below. We are not charged a fee for this form of payment. Checks should be sent to:
```
Bridge Foundry
606 E Juneau Ave #511398
Milwaukee, WI 53203
```
**Make sure to list Bridge Foundry General Fund (or optionally a specific Bridge or Chapter) in the memo so funds are allocated correctly!** Examples: RailsBridge Boston-MA, GoBridge Portland-OR. This is especially important if an invoice was not sent for some reason.

## Paypal
Paypal is an option if preferred (there are fees with paypal 2.7-3.1% + $.30 per transaction.)

## Credit Card Payment
Since this is our most expensive form of payment, we usually leave this method off the invoice. If you would like to include it, please make a note of that in the comments section of the Invoice Request Form. There will be a "Pay Now" button on the invoice that is sent to the sponsor. If they would like to pay with a credit card, let the sponsor know they can select the credit card payment option on the invoice when they receive it. Please note that we are charged 3.40% + 25¢ per transaction for credit card fees, so you may want to consider that when considering donations by credit card.

## Please note
Checks are processed weekly.

Paypal donations get processed on the first and third Friday of every month.

Available funds will be noted in the [Master Accounting Spreasheet](../monitoring-your-funds.md).

If a sponsor check or payment is not reflected in the recipient's account in enough time prior to an upcoming workshop, don’t worry! You may use funds from the Bridge Foundry general sponsorship fund to cover your expenses until we receive it. Contact us.
