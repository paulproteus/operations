# About Grants
Bridge Foundry is committed to providing financial support to anyone who wants to organize a workshop. Independent Communities are able to take advantage of this support by applying for a grant.

## Funded Grants
In most cases, a [Volunteer Fundraiser](https://rebrand.ly/volunteer-fundraiser-policies) from your area solicits donations from local sponsors and then you can apply for a grant to receive those funds. We call these [Funded Grants](https://github.com/bridgefoundry/operations/blob/master/grants/funded-grants.md).

## Seed Fund Grants
In cases where you are unsuccessful in raising funds to support your workshop, you can still apply for a grant! We call these [Seed Fund Grants](https://github.com/bridgefoundry/operations/blob/master/grants/seed-grants.md) and they have their own approval process.

## Application
In both cases, the process starts by filling out a [Grant Application](https://docs.google.com/a/ultrasaurus.com/forms/d/1npx6D7iFl6yx6kBVlYTOG1-PiWMsDiTx_TQWNri1WIk/viewform).
