## Custom PayPal Buttons
Chapters have the option of embedding a PayPal donation button on their website. (This option isn't available for Independent Communities.)

Request a PayPal button by completing [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeS0v8d29QVH2I3CISaX2aI-6ASLJgn5CFvqAnzSjZ9jGBKzg/viewform?usp=sf_link). The form can be submitted by any registered Volunteer Fundraiser for your Chapter. 

Prior to requesting a button, decide whether you want it to redirect back to your website after the donor pays or not. A best practice is to create a donation thank you page on your website, and have the button redirect there after the donation. If you go this route, you will need to set up this page on your website prior to requesting a button.

You will receive your new PayPal button code via email within a week (usually less). If you don't see the button come through within a few days, feel free to email us at finance@bridgefoundry.org.
