# Employer Match Programs

Many employers offer matching gifts for donations and/or volunteer hours made by their employees. If you want to accept donations for your Chapter or Bridge this way, let us know! We are unfortunately unable to accept donations this way for Independent Communities.

Many employers manage their employer match program through [Benevity](https://causes.benevity.org/) (including Google, Microsoft, Apple, and more). We already have an account through Benevity, and we can add your Chapter, Bridge, or Program as a sub "project" upon request.

We can support a variety of other employer match programs as well. In most cases there is a simple process to add our nonprofit to their system and then we can start accepting donations. It is always important to make sure the donations are accurately labeled so they get to the right Chapter or Bridge.

Bottom line: If you are interested in raising money this way, contact us at finance@bridgefoundry.org.
