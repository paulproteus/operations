# Using Funds

Once you have [raised donations](https://github.com/bridgefoundry/operations/tree/master/fundraising) or received a grant for your group's activities, there are a few things to keep in mind for spending the money.

## Approved Expenses
All expenses must follow the [approved expenses policy](https://github.com/bridgefoundry/operations/blob/master/using-funds/approved-expenses-policy.md). When in doubt about whether something follows the policy, ask us!

## Documentation Requirements
Receipts are required for all expenses, regardless of how they are paid for or the type of group you have. Plan ahead to make sure you can receive adequate documentation.

Receipts for all expenses must reflect the **dollar amount, proof of payment, and an itemized list of the items** purchased. 

In some cases this means submitting multiple receipts (for example, restaurants often have separate receipts for itemized charges and proof of payment with tip amount.) Invoices that don't list an amount paid do not count as receipts, but again, you can submit them along with a proof of payment receipt if only the invoice lists itemized detail.

If you are working with an on-site service provider like a babysitter, print out a copy of our receipt [template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByFHpp-IkBaFbnBZTndCWTktcmc/view?usp=sharing) in case they don't have their own receipts and have them fill one out for you.

## Payment options

### Reimbursement
Most volunteers get reimbursed via Expensify. The system allows you to submit your receipts and then receive a direct deposit reimbursement to your bank account.

### Pex Cards
Chapter and Bridge Leaders have the option of applying for a prepaid cash card (Pex card), allowing them to pay directly for expenses. They are required to submit receipts via Expensify by 5 days after month end for all expenses charged to the card.

### Direct Pay
Chapters and Bridges can also have Bridge Foundry pay directly for expenses. This can be done via having the vendor bill us or sometimes we can call them with credit card information. This works best for payments that have at least a week lead time so we can make arrangements.

### Cash Advances
For Independent Communities that don't have volunteers who can afford to advance the funds and be reimbursed, we can usually send funds in advance. Submitting receipts on time via Expensify is extra important in this case, and you will need to send back any unused funds.
